# Loot Corner

Loot Corner is a full-stack e-commerce web application for selling collectible products such as figures, posters, and accessories.

This project is being prepared as a real client-ready application, not just a demo. The backend, authentication, authorization, environment configuration, deployment flow, and production safety checks should be treated seriously before launch.

## Tech Stack

## Security Model

This project follows these rules:

- Never trust the client.
- Frontend checks are only for user experience.
- Protected data and protected actions must be checked on the server.
- Admin actions must require server-side admin authorization.
- Customer data must be scoped to the logged-in user.
- API routes must validate request bodies, route params, and query params.
- API routes must not return password hashes, tokens, secrets, raw database errors, or stack traces.
- Secrets must stay server-side.
- OAuth client secrets must be stored only in local or hosting environment variables, never in Git.
- Google OAuth callback URLs must exactly match the current domain and Better Auth callback route.
- Google sign-in authenticates a user, but admin authorization must still come from the database `User.role`.
- Only variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser.
- This project should not expose secrets through `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables.
- Prisma is used for database access instead of unsafe raw SQL.
- Passwords must never be stored in plain text.
- Rate limiting should be enabled for auth routes, public APIs, and protected mutation routes.
- Resend verification email requests must have a stricter backend rate limit, not only a frontend cooldown.
- CSRF or same-origin checks should protect cookie-based state-changing requests.
- Admin filters and pagination must be validated server-side; the frontend must not load everything and filter sensitive data locally.
- Product prices and stock decisions must be calculated on the server, not trusted from client-submitted values.
- Discount pricing must be validated server-side and order items must store price snapshots.
- Hiding stock counts from customers is display-only; backend stock validation must still run.
- Stock deduction must be protected against double deduction and should happen only through the reviewed admin confirmation flow.
- Important business records such as orders should not be hard-deleted unless a separate retention/audit policy is reviewed.

## Requirements

Recommended:

- Node.js 20+
- npm
- Docker Desktop, for local PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL, local through Docker or hosted in production
- Cloudinary account for production image uploads
- Upstash Redis database for production rate limiting
- SMTP provider for production emails

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`.

On macOS/Linux/Git Bash:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Never commit `.env` or any file containing real secrets.

Required variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME"

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="long-random-production-secret-at-least-32-characters"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Optional Google sign-in / OAuth
# Keep these empty if Google sign-in is not configured for this environment.
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""

# App URL used when generating email links
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# SMTP email settings
SMTP_HOST=""
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER=""
SMTP_PASSWORD=""
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=""
SMTP_FROM_NAME="Loot Corner"

# Email delivery mode
# Use "log" for local/staging without real SMTP sending.
# Use "smtp" for production after configuring a real SMTP provider.
EMAIL_DELIVERY_MODE="log"

# Upstash Redis rate limiting
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=""
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=""

# Cloudinary product image uploads
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=""
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=""
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=""
CLOUDINARY_PRODUCT_FOLDER="loot-corner/products"
```

For production, use the real deployed HTTPS domain:

```env
BETTER_AUTH_URL="https://your-domain.com"
APP_URL="https://your-domain.com"
```

Do not use local URLs in production:

```env
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

If Google sign-in is enabled, each environment needs its own Google OAuth client or carefully separated OAuth credentials. The Google Cloud authorized redirect URI must exactly match the deployed domain and Better Auth callback path:

```txt
Local:      http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
Staging:    https://your-staging-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google
Production: https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google
```

Do not commit real Google OAuth client secrets. Store them only in local `.env` files or hosting provider environment variables.

For Neon/PostgreSQL setups that use connection pooling, keep the application runtime URL and migration/direct URL separate:

```env
# Runtime / app connection, usually pooled if using Neon pooling
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST-POOLER/DB_NAME?sslmode=require"

# Direct database connection for Prisma migrations
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DB_NAME?sslmode=require"
```

Do not commit real database URLs or credentials.

## Local Development Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the local PostgreSQL database:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Run local Prisma migrations:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:dev
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the app:

```txt
http://localhost:3000
```

## Database and Prisma

Use this for local development migrations against a local development database:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:dev
```

Use this when applying already-committed migrations to staging/production-style databases:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

Generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

Open Prisma Studio locally:

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

Do not use `prisma db push` against production.

`db push` is only for local development or quick schema experiments. Production and staging should use committed Prisma migrations with `prisma migrate deploy`.

## Useful Scripts

Run unit tests once:

```bash
npm run test:run
```

Run unit tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test
```

Generate test coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Run Playwright E2E tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Run Playwright E2E tests in headed browser mode:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

Open Playwright UI mode:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

Open the last Playwright HTML report:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build the production app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server after building:

```bash
npm run start
```

Run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Run linting and type checking:

```bash
npm run check
```

Recommended local pre-merge checks:

```bash
npm run test:run
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Run local development migrations:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:dev
```

Apply committed migrations in staging or production:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

Generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

Open Prisma Studio:

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

## Docker Development Database

The Docker Compose setup is for local development only.

Example local database URL:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://loot_corner:loot_corner_dev_password@localhost:5436/loot_corner"
```

Do not use the local Docker database for production.

Production should use a hosted PostgreSQL database with a private connection string stored in the deployment provider's secret/environment settings.

## Testing Flow

Recommended testing order:

```txt
unit tests -> manual staging testing -> Playwright E2E tests -> small load/smoke test after tooling/license review
```

Current unit testing stack:

- Vitest
- React Testing Library
- jsdom
- mocked Prisma / external services where needed

Current E2E testing stack:

- Playwright
- Chromium-only browser project for now
- staging-safe base URL
- one worker to avoid free-plan abuse
- saved Playwright auth state for customer/admin sessions
- screenshots, video, and traces only for failures/retries

Unit tests should not touch the staging or production database.

Playwright E2E tests currently run against staging or localhost only. The staging database contains disposable test data only.

Do not run heavy load tests against free staging services. For staging, keep any future load/smoke testing small and safe.

## Playwright E2E Testing

Playwright E2E tests live in:

```txt
tests/e2e/
```

Run all E2E tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Run with a visible browser:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

Open Playwright UI mode:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

Open the latest HTML report:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### Required Local E2E Environment

Create this local-only file:

```txt
.env.e2e.local
```

Required values:

```env
E2E_BASE_URL="https://loot-corner.onrender.com"

E2E_CUSTOMER_EMAIL="test-customer@example.com"
E2E_CUSTOMER_PASSWORD="local-test-password"

E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL="test-admin@example.com"
E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD="local-test-password"

E2E_PRODUCT_PATH="/products/example-product"
E2E_ORDER_PRODUCT_PATH="/products/example-product-with-stock"
```

Do not commit `.env.e2e.local`.

### E2E Safety Rules

- Run E2E tests only against staging or localhost.
- Do not run E2E tests against production.
- Do not commit Playwright auth state.
- Do not commit Playwright screenshots, videos, traces, or reports.
- Keep workers low to avoid abusing free staging services.
- Avoid image upload tests unless Cloudinary usage and cleanup are controlled.
- Avoid email inbox automation while `EMAIL_DELIVERY_MODE="log"`.
- Use dedicated test customer/admin accounts.
- Use products with enough stock for order tests.

### Playwright Auth State

The E2E suite saves logged-in customer/admin sessions under:

```txt
tests/e2e/.auth/
```

If login state becomes stale, delete that folder and rerun:

```bash
rm -rf tests/e2e/.auth
npm run test:e2e
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force tests/e2e/.auth
npm run test:e2e
```

### Current E2E Coverage

Current Playwright coverage includes:

- public homepage/products smoke tests
- customer login
- customer cart add/cleanup
- customer authenticated pages
- controlled customer order creation with delivery checkout confirmation
- guest auth guard behavior
- admin read-only pages
- admin orders read-only API/page behavior

## Staging Notes

The staging environment may use free plans while testing, such as Render free web service, Neon free Postgres, Upstash free Redis, Cloudinary free plan, and `EMAIL_DELIVERY_MODE="log"`.

Free services are for staging/testing only. Avoid heavy traffic, stress tests, or behavior that could violate provider limits.

Production should use paid/reliable hosting, paid or production-ready database backups, real SMTP configuration, and production secrets separate from staging.

## Production Deployment Flow

Before deploying:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
npm run build
```

Apply production migrations during deployment:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

Start the app:

```bash
npm run start
```

Depending on the hosting provider, migrations may run as a release command, deploy hook, or CI/CD step.

Important production rules:

- Do not manually edit the production database schema.
- Do not run `prisma migrate dev` in production.
- Do not run `prisma db push` in production.
- Always commit Prisma migration files.
- Back up the production database before the first real launch and before risky schema changes.

## Release Versioning

Use Git tags for deployed releases only. Do not describe a version as released or tagged until the tag has actually been created and pushed.

Current known tag state from the repository screenshot: `v0.6.0` is the latest visible tag. Work after that tag should be treated as post-`v0.6.0` development until a new tag is intentionally created.

Recommended version format:

```txt
v0.1.0  internal hardening release
v0.5.0-legal-pages-checkpoint  legal/customer policy checkpoint
v0.6.0  checkout delivery and admin category management checkpoint
v0.7.0  candidate tag for post-v0.6.0 hardening work, only if created and pushed
v1.0.0  first production launch
v1.0.1  production bug fix
v1.1.0  small feature release
v2.0.0  major or breaking release
```

Use descriptive checkpoint tags before production when helpful, and reserve `v1.0.0` for the first real production launch.

Create a release tag only after checks pass and after the matching commit is merged/deployed:

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
git status
git tag -a v0.7.0 -m "Release v0.7.0"
git push origin v0.7.0
```

Replace `v0.7.0` with the version you actually intend to release. Tag the exact commit that is deployed.

For production releases, prefer this flow:

```txt
feature branch -> pull request -> main -> deployment -> version tag
```

## Current Business Logic Notes

### Checkout and Delivery

Delivery areas/prices currently live in code configuration, not in an admin-editable database table.

Current delivery options:

- Nablus receive/pickup point: 0 NIS
- West Bank cities: 20 NIS
- Jerusalem: 30 NIS
- 48 lands: 70 NIS
- West Jerusalem + Ein Rafa + Ein Naqouba + Abu Ghosh: 45 NIS

Orders store a snapshot of the selected delivery area, delivery price, city/address/details, notes, and pickup agreement status. This is intentional so old orders remain historically accurate even if delivery prices change later.

### Stock Confirmation Flow

The current order flow is:

1. Customer places an order.
2. The order is created as pending/unconfirmed.
3. The store owner confirms the order by WhatsApp or phone.
4. Stock decreases only when the admin confirms the order.
5. If stock is no longer available when the admin confirms, the app blocks confirmation and shows a clear admin error.

Stock deduction is tracked so the same order is not deducted twice. Older orders were protected during the migration/backfill so existing order history stays safe.

### Admin Filtering and Pagination

Admin orders, products, and categories use server-side filters and capped pagination instead of loading every record into the browser. This keeps the admin dashboard faster as data grows and avoids exposing more data than the current screen needs.

### Order Retention

Cancelled orders are not hard-deleted or archived by default. Keeping order history visible is safer for audit, customer support, inventory debugging, and dispute handling.

### Stock Visibility Control

Admins can choose whether customers can see exact stock counts per product. This is a display choice only; backend stock validation still runs regardless of whether the count is visible to customers.

### Product Discounts

Admins can add an optional discounted price to products. Customers see the discounted price with the original price shown as the old price, and order items keep price snapshots so historical orders do not change if product prices or discounts change later.

The server calculates the effective product price for cart/order totals. The client must not be trusted to submit product prices or discount values.

### Google Sign-in

Google sign-in is supported through Better Auth OAuth configuration while email/password authentication remains available. Google OAuth credentials are optional per environment, so the app can run without Google sign-in when `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` or `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` is not configured.

Google authentication does not decide admin access. Admin permissions still come from the database-backed user role and must be enforced by server-side authorization checks.

Each deployed environment needs the correct Google OAuth callback URL:

```txt
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
https://your-staging-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google
https://your-production-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google
```

### Planned Delivery Pricing Dashboard

Delivery areas/prices still live in code configuration. The next safe improvement is to move them to an admin-managed database table while preserving the existing order delivery area/price snapshots for audit-safe historical orders.

## Branch Workflow

Use feature branches for changes:

```bash
git switch main
git pull origin main
git switch -c feature-name
```

After changes are tested:

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
git status
git add .
git commit -m "clear commit message"
git push -u origin feature-name
```

Open a pull request, review the changes, then merge into `main`.

Do not make production changes directly on `main` unless it is an emergency hotfix.

## Authentication and Authorization

Authentication answers:

```txt
Who is the user?
```

Authorization answers:

```txt
What is this user allowed to do?
```

This project must check both.

Examples:

- A signed-in customer can access their own cart.
- A signed-in customer must not access another customer's cart or orders.
- A signed-in customer must not access admin APIs.
- An admin can access admin APIs.
- Hiding admin buttons in the frontend is not enough.

Protected server routes and API routes must always check authorization server-side.

## File and Secret Safety

Do not commit:

```txt
.env
.env.local
.env.production
.env.staging
.env.backup
.env.e2e.local
node_modules/
.next/
generated/
tests/e2e/.auth/
test-results/
playwright-report/
blob-report/
```

Safe to commit:

```txt
.env.example
prisma/schema.prisma
prisma/migrations/
src/
public/
README.md
package.json
package-lock.json
```

## Email Delivery Notes

For local development and staging, use:

```env
EMAIL_DELIVERY_MODE="log"
```

This prevents real emails from being sent while still allowing the app to test email flows safely.

For production, configure a real SMTP provider and use:

```env
EMAIL_DELIVERY_MODE="smtp"
```

Do not use personal Gmail SMTP for production client email. Use a real transactional email provider and verify the sending domain.

## Legal and Licensing Notes

Before commercial delivery:

- Review dependency licenses.
- Review image/icon/font licenses.
- Do not use paid templates, copied UI kits, or proprietary assets without permission.
- Do not commit licensed assets unless the client has the right to use them.
- Keep proof of license or permission for commercial assets.

## Project Notes

This app is still being hardened for production. It has passed the checkout delivery, admin category, admin order confirmation, admin filtering, customer stock visibility, product discount, and Google sign-in checkpoints, but it should not be treated as fully production-ready until the remaining business rules, deployment checklist, staging tests, and client review are complete.

Next safest checkpoints:

1. Verify Google sign-in on staging/production with exact callback URLs and separate environment secrets.
2. Admin-editable delivery pricing dashboard.
3. Caching/performance review after the core business rules are stable.

Before launch, complete the production deployment checklist and test the full customer and admin flows on the deployed domain.
